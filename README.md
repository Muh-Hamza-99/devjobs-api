# 📲 Devjobs API

# 📃 Description

A secure and feature-rich API that allows companies to post jobs and for developers to build profiles. Companies are verified through two-step authentication and developers can create tech-based profiles, with an emphasis on technical skills.

*Will try and build a frontend in the near future...before the end of this year.*
